## 🔗 The Complete Flow

Here's how everything connects:

```
Client Website
    ↓ (loads widget via script tag)
Widget JS/CSS (Netlify/Render Static)
    ↓ (user sends message)
Widget → API Request → Render API Server
    ↓ (proxy request)
Render API → n8n Webhook
    ↓ (AI processing)
n8n → AI Response → Render API
    ↓ (return response)
Render API → Widget → Client sees response
```

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

Clients can customize the widget by adding configuration:

```html
<script>
  window.FabCityConfig = {
    apiUrl: 'https://your-custom-api.com',  // Optional: custom API
    // Future options:
    // theme: 'dark',
    // position: 'bottom-left',
    // primaryColor: '#667eea'
  };
</script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
<script src="..."></script>
```
